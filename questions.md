It’s easier to keep track of code when it’s all in one big class or component anyway. <BR>

<input type="radio" value="check2"> Don’t take on another object’s or component’s job. Tell it what to do, and stick to your own job. <BR>

<input type="radio" value="check3"> Checking in code with warn- ings is just as bad as checking in code with errors or code that fails its tests. No checked-in code should produce any warnings from the build tools. <BR>

>A5 : Because names are everywhere in software. We name our variables, our functions, our arguments, classes, and packages. We name our source files and the directories that contain them. We name our jar files and war files and ear files.Then, because we do so much of it, we’d better do it well.
